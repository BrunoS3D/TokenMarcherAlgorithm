# Token Marcher Algorithm
A basic, modifiable, and high performance text tokenizer algorithm small enough to fit on a business card without using regular expressions.

This code was stripped from one of our internal parser libraries but is structured to allow modifications. You can use this code for creating your own parsers, calculators, translators, text editors, console systems, etc. The algorithm is small and fast, capable of tokenizing 1,000 lines of C# source code with over 8,200 tokens in under 2 ms on a quad core CPU @ 3.2 GHz.
